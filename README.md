Snowball: Extracting Relations from Large Plain-Text Collections
================================================================

This is my own implementation of the the Snowball system to bootstrap relationship instances. You can find more details about the original system here:

A sample file containing sentences where the named-entities are already tagged can be [downloaded](http://data.davidsbatista.net/sentences.txt.bz2), which has 1 million sentences taken from the New York Times articles part of the English Gigaword Collection.

**NOTE**: look at the desription of [BREDS](https://github.com/davidsbatista/BREDS) to understand how to give a tagged document collection and seeds to setup the bootstrapping of relationship instances with Snowball, both systems have a similar setup.
